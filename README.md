# IT SD Group Project

The main repo of the app folder for the game project excluding assets folder.

We have made **TWO AI implementations**. The Original AI (ai/original), which was all made by William T Manson had incredible amount of details and cases but because of lack of time, we weren't able to solve all its bugs so we considered more appropriate to make a second, more simple implementation.
